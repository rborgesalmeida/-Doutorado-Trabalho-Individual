   abstract = {Context Systematic mapping studies are used to structure a research area, while systematic reviews are focused on gathering and synthesizing evidence. The most recent guidelines for systematic mapping are from 2008. Since that time, many suggestions have been made of how to improve systematic literature reviews (SLRs). There is a need to evaluate how researchers conduct the process of systematic mapping and identify how the guidelines should be updated based on the lessons learned from the existing systematic maps and SLR guidelines. Objective To identify how the systematic mapping process is conducted (including search, study selection, analysis and presentation of data, etc.); to identify improvement potentials in conducting the systematic mapping process and updating the guidelines accordingly. Method We conducted a systematic mapping study of systematic maps, considering some practices of systematic review guidelines as well (in particular in relation to defining the search and to conduct a quality assessment). Results In a large number of studies multiple guidelines are used and combined, which leads to different ways in conducting mapping studies. The reason for combining guidelines was that they differed in the recommendations given. Conclusion The most frequently followed guidelines are not sufficient alone. Hence, there was a need to provide an update of how to conduct systematic mapping studies. New guidelines have been proposed consolidating existing findings. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. },

Termed as Internet of Things (IoT) evolving into Internet of Everything, the new ecosystem combines wireless sensor networks, cloud computing, analytical data, interactive technologies, as well as smart devices, to provision solutions in which the objects are embedded with network connectivity and an identifier to enhance object-to-object interactions. IoT innovation is advancing and provides diverse smart solutions or applications. From e-transport to e-health; smart living to e-manufacturing and many other e-solutions. In this environment, the rising trend of cyber attacks on systems infrastructure coupled with the system inherent vulnerabilities presents a source of concern not only to the vendors, but also to the consumer. These security concerns need to be addressed in order to ensure user confidence so as to promote wide acceptance and reap the potentials of IoT. From the perspectives of firmware, hardware and software infrastructure setups, this paper looks at some of the major IoT application and service domains, and analyze the cybersecurity challenges which are likely to drive IoT research in the near future.",

abstract={With Internet of Things (IoT), new and improved personal, commercial and social opportunities can be explored and availed. However, with this extended network, the corresponding threat landscape will become more complex and much harder to control as vulnerabilities inherited by individual things will be multiplied. Conventional security controls, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS) etc., may show some level of resistance to this self-organizing network but, as standalone mechanisms, are not sufficient to analyze the threat in a particular context. They fail to provide the essential context of a threat and yields false positives-negatives which can trigger pointless re-configurations, service unavailability and end user discomfort. Such unwanted events can be very catastrophic, for instance, in an IoT enabled eHealth services. We need to have an autonomous adaptive risk management solution for IoT, which can analyze an adverse situation in a distinct context and manage the risk involved intelligently so that the end user, service and security preferences are well-preserved. This paper details an event driven adaptive security model for IoT to approach the objective specified and explicates how it can be utilized in an eHealth scenario to protect against a threat faced at runtime.},

ABSTRACT = {In Internet of Things (IoT), the main driving technologies are considered to be tiny sensory objects. These objects cannot host traditional preventive and detective technologies to provide protection against the increasing threat sophistication. Furthermore, these solutions are limited to analyzing particular contextual information, for instance network information or files, and do not provide holistic context for risk analysis and response. Analyzing a part of a situation may lead to false alarms and later to unnecessary and incorrect configurations. To overcome these concerns, we proposed an event-driven adaptive security (EDAS) model for IoT. EDAS aims to observe security events (changes) generated by various things in the monitored IoT environment, investigates any intentional or unintentional risks associated with the events and adapts to it autonomously. It correlates different events in time and space to reduce any false alarms and provides a mechanism to predict attacks before they are realized. Risks are responded to autonomically by utilizing a runtime adaptation ontology. The mitigation action is chosen after assessing essential information, such as the risk faced, user preferences, device capabilities and service requirements. Thus, it selects an optimal mitigation action in a particular adverse situation. The objective of this paper is to investigate EDAS feasibility and its aptitude as a real-world prototype in a remote patient monitoring context. It details how EDAS can be a practical choice for IoT-eHealth in terms of the security, design and implementation features it offers as compared to traditional security controls. We have explained the prototype’s major components and have highlighted the key technical challenges.},

ABSTRACT = {Dynamic and heterogeneous smart spaces cause challenges for security because it is impossible to anticipate all the possible changes at design-time. Self-adaptive security is an applicable solution for this challenge. This paper presents an architectural approach for security adaptation in smart spaces. The approach combines an adaptation loop, Information Security Measuring Ontology (ISMO) and a smart space security-control model. The adaptation loop includes phases to monitor, analyze, plan and execute changes in the smart space. The ISMO offers input knowledge for the adaptation loop and the security-control model enforces dynamic access control policies. The approach is novel because it defines the whole adaptation loop and knowledge required in each phase of the adaptation. The contributions are validated as a part of the smart space pilot implementation. The approach offers reusable and extensible means to achieve adaptive security in smart spaces and up-to-date access control for devices that appear in the space. Hence, the approach supports the work of smart space application developers.},

abstract="Since the open architecture at the perception layer, the IoT not only faces the traditional security risks in TCP/IP network, but also faces the new emerging risks. In this paper, through analysising the infrastructure of IoT and the security risks in IoT, a new multi-layer security model is proposed, which aims to improve the security technique in IoT. Based on the new model, a series of effective ways to the security risks are discussed at each different layer, respectively. The characteristics of the model and the application domain are summarized to give out, too.",

Security, trust and privacy concerns are the cornerstone requirements of a social Internet of Things, where users want to share and obtain information in a huge opportunistic environment of connected devices and services. The paper presents an IoT security framework, being devised in the scope of SOCIOTAL EU project, which is based on the Architecture Reference Model (ARM) of IoT-A EU project. The framework extends the traditional ARM putting strong emphasis on security, trust and privacy concerns in order to cope with more opportunistic and secure sharing models required in a social-aware IoT scenarios, where users can set up dynamically communities and bubbles of devices and users.",

ABSTRACT = {Context aware applications, which can adapt their behaviors to changing environments, are attracting more and more attention. To simplify the complexity of developing applications, context aware middleware, which introduces context awareness into the traditional middleware, is highlighted to provide a homogeneous interface involving generic context management solutions. This paper provides a survey of state-of-the-art context aware middleware architectures proposed during the period from 2009 through 2015. First, a preliminary background, such as the principles of context, context awareness, context modelling, and context reasoning, is provided for a comprehensive understanding of context aware middleware. On this basis, an overview of eleven carefully selected middleware architectures is presented and their main features explained. Then, thorough comparisons and analysis of the presented middleware architectures are performed based on technical parameters including architectural style, context abstraction, context reasoning, scalability, fault tolerance, interoperability, service discovery, storage, security &amp; privacy, context awareness level, and cloud-based big data analytics. The analysis shows that there is actually no context aware middleware architecture that complies with all requirements. Finally, challenges are pointed out as open issues for future work.},
